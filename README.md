# To-Do List App

## Description

This To-Do app is a simple, user-friendly application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app leverages Local Storage to save tasks directly in the browser, ensuring that the user's tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Read Tasks:** View all your tasks in a neatly organized list.
- **Update Tasks:** Edit the details of any existing task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the app.
- **CSS:** Styling of the app, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript:** Functionality of the app, including CRUD operations and interaction with Local Storage.
